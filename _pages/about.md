# What is this page, and what is it for?
This page serves as a digital manifestation and collection of what I would deem to be my greatest acheivements during not only my education, but also my professional career. It will be amended as time goes on with new stuff added in as I see fit. It shall be used as an example to employers why they I am a good canidate for the position. It will also serve valuable in the event that I wish to seek an education higher than the one I am obtaining now, as not only a refernece guide, but also as a show of experience for grad school. 

# So, who am I? Why do I matter?
I am a product of my raising, I was born to a lower middle class family in a poverty stricken, old coal mining town. After a few minor setbacks in life I went on to graduate from Alexander High School in Albany, Ohio. It was here where I first learned of my love for technology, as I would often repair my classmates game controllers when they went awry. After I graduated I went to business school for a year, where I would learn just how much I did not like business school as I had no intrest in it, ultimately leading me to Hocking College where I intend to obtain my degree in Cybersecurity and Operating Systems. 

#Minor note
I often write in a conversational tone, I enjoy learning about others and wish for others to learn about me. This will reflect in this document.
