### Malware Awareness Blog
One type of Malware I find to be most interesting is Spyware, while not problematic in and of itself, what it collects is terrifying. Spyware is often delivered to a system in the form of a trojan horse, convincing your system that what you are installing is fine, or it packages itself inside of perfectly safe software. Regardless of how it gets into your system, it can monitor keystrokes, location services, browsing data, whatever it wants. It manages all of this by changing your system settings. 

I decided to look more into the Israeli NSO group and their Pegasus Spyware. It is a zero-click spyware, meaning it is able to get onto a device without any action taken by the device or its owner. It can listen in on calls, harvest messages, look at photos and location services, and so forth. An interesting fact about this Spyware is its installation fee, costing contractors upwards of five hundred to six hundred thousand dollars for just ten phones to be tapped. While NSO group claims that it only hacks the phones of drug and sex traffickers and other dangerous criminals, certain events have been called into speculation after political leaders and activists were tapped and some, like Jamal Khashoggi, were killed, though the NSO group denies any claims of their involvement.

So, if this kind of malware just infects your system through seemingly legitimate downloads, what can you do? The best thing you can do is set up a tier system for downloads, set up a scanner for new downloads, and scan files after you download them. This combined with a reliable anti-spyware program will keep you from being tracked as more often than not, the spyware will be caught.
