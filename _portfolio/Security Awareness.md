### Malware Awareness Blog
One type of Malware I find to be most intresting is Spyware, while not problematic in and of itself, what it collects is terrifying. Spyware is often delivered to a system in the form of a trojan horse, convincing your system that what you are installing is fine, or it packages itself inside of perfectly safe software. Regardless of how it gets into your system, it can monitor keystrokes, location services, browsing data, whatever it wants. It manages all of this by changing your system settings. 

I decided to look more into the Isreli NSO group and their Pegsus Spyware. It is a zero-click spyware, meaning it is able to get onto a device without any action taken by the device or its owner. It can listen in on calls, harvest messages, look at photos and location services, and so forth. An intresting fact about this Spyware is its installation fee, costing contractors upwards of five hundred to six hundred thousand dollars for just ten phones to be tapped. While NSO group claims that it only hacks the phones of drug and sex trafficers and other dangerous criminals, certain events have been called into speculation after political leaders and activists were tapped and some, like Jamal Khashoggi, were killed, though the NSO group denies any claims of their involvement.
