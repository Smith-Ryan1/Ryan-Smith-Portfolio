### Malware Awareness Blog
One type of Malware I find to be most interesting is Spyware, while not problematic in and of itself, what it collects is terrifying. Spyware is often delivered to a system in the form of a trojan horse, convincing your system that what you are installing is fine, or it packages itself inside of perfectly safe software. Regardless of how it gets into your system, it can monitor keystrokes, location services, browsing data, whatever it wants. It manages all of this by changing your system settings. 

I decided to look more into the Israeli NSO group and their Pegasus Spyware. It is a zero-click spyware, meaning it is able to get onto a device without any action taken by the device or its owner. It can listen in on calls, harvest messages, look at photos and location services, and so forth. An interesting fact about this Spyware is its installation fee, costing contractors upwards of five hundred to six hundred thousand dollars for just ten phones to be tapped. While NSO group claims that it only hacks the phones of drug and sex traffickers and other dangerous criminals, certain events have been called into speculation after political leaders and activists were tapped and some, like Jamal Khashoggi, were killed, though the NSO group denies any claims of their involvement.

So, if this kind of malware just infects your system through seemingly legitimate downloads, what can you do? The best thing you can do is set up a tier system for downloads, set up a scanner for new downloads, and scan files after you download them. This combined with a reliable anti-spyware program will keep you from being tracked as more often than not, the spyware will be caught.

# Week four: Malware Awareness


I would say my five best security tips are to: 

never answer phone calls with "yes" as people can then use a recording of your affirmation and use that to make transactions

never give personal information to people you do not know over the phone or email

Never click on links you do not know the validity of.

Double-check a email senders spelling and grammar as many incorrect spellings can be an indicator of a malicious actor.

And to just always be cautious when recieving email, even if it is addressed as someone you know, people can easilly change their address name when sending an email.

Malware comes in many different forms, some you have to activate, others activate themselves. Regardless, you should always scan downloads for malicious code, never download anything from suspicious looking sites, and do not click on links sent to you by unknown persons. Avoid these and you should be fine.

Cybersecurity awareness month is a good time for those that know about cyberthreats to teach the young and old that may not realize exactly what damage attackers can do. It is also a perfect time to take invintory of devices and ensure that there is nothing malicious lying dormant in ones system.
