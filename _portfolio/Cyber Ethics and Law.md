# OSS and Disclosure Readiness
### License choice
I believe if I were to choose a open source license I would choose Apache. I feel it is the most middle ground of the three, requiring you to distribute changes to the source code while keeping patents. The original creators of works should see some sort of benifit from what they do, however, information should be readilly available and easy to access. 

### SIV (Safe Initial Vulnerability) Report

The template provided is a rephrasing of the template provided by cisa.gov at https://www.cisa.gov/vulnerability-disclosure-policy-template?utm_source=chatgpt.com I have simply reworded most parts into a more re-constructable phrasing for future use. Most of the information provided by the template was perfectly applicable, if a bit wordy.

### Whats next?
I want to look more deeply at some of the different creative commons licenses as that seems to be a mess within itself. However, with the symbol system it uses it should not be too hard to differentiate the nuancies of each licence. I can only see me learning more about different copyleft and right policys as a benifit as I do not know when, not if but when, I will use open source material and I wish to attribute properly.
