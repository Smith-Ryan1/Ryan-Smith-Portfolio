# Overview

My final project started out as a way to take in names and give them a unique number for the purposes of raffles like at football games. What I came away with was a user friendly interface that allows for any application of names and numbers. From raffle winnings to employee IDs. 

Ultimately, with this project I learned to adapt on the go, pushing the envelope just a little further with each successful iteration of a project. I learned to go through class setups, admittedly reciving help from AI. Ultimately, AI would just give you an answer, all I wanted was the setup process. What became of it helped me take my random number generator from a standalone system to a modular piece of code that I can apply else where.
