Ram has two major types, SRAM and DRAM. SRAM retains information written onto it as long as power is supplied. DRAM stores binary signals as electrical impulses and could need to be recharged after a period of time.
DRAM also has many different categories, including:

|Type of Ram| Its use|
|----|-----|
|ADRAM Asynchronous DRAM| a memory controller determines the timing of data impulses, the CPU must account for this delay.|
|SDRAM Sychronous DRAM| The timing of the data impulses from the RAM is tied to the CPUs internal clock.|
|DDR SDRAM Double data rate| Like SDRAM except it impulses on both ends of the CPU's clock cycle.|
|RDRAM Rambus DRAM| transfers the data signals much faster over a smaller CPU-memory bus.|
|Cache DRAM| uses a cache system using SRAM that allows the main DRAM work faster by having information on hand.|

Storage drives in computers allow it to, obviously, store data. There are two main different types of storage drive, those being HDDs and SSDs. HDDs, Hard Disk Drives, contain magnetic, spinning disks. These disks spin at reletively low RPMs, which dictate how fast your computer can read the data, making them a bit slower than SSDs. Furthermore, this spinning requires power, and generates heat. SSDs, Solid State Drives, rely on flash data, making them faster. They also have no moving parts making them more heat effiecent and less likely to be damaged from blunt force trauma. SSDs however, are more expensive than HDDs, making them a less budget friendly option.

### HDDS vs SDDS vs SSHD

Ultimately, storage devices depend on two things, cost and storage nessesity, which are dependent on the user. 
HDDS are ultimately the budget option. They are typically larger, but read slower, and, again, cost less. As such, I would suggest this in the event you do not need fast file loading, this is a good storage drive for your day to day web browsing.
SSDS are smaller, run faster, and of course, cost more. I would reccomend a SSD if you have the spare cash and need to access files faster, SSDs cost most per gigabyte.
SDHDs are a combination of both an HDDs larger capacity, and a SSDs faster use time. Furthermore, it is in the middle cost wise. Slower than a typical SSD and middle of the road in the spectrum of SDHDs. This would be best if you ultimately did not know what you wanted, or if you are unsure what would be best for your use case. 

So, to recap, HDDs have vast storage but slow use time. Best for browsing the web or low speed work. SSDs are fast but have low capacity, would be best for work that can be deleted afterward to save on storage but needs quick access. SDHDs are middle of the road storage devices, best of both worlds, cannot particularly go wrong if you do not know your usecase.
